  abstract  = "Abstract The field of molecular evolution has experienced
               explosive growth in recent years due to the rapid accumulation
               of genetic sequence data, continuous improvements to computer
               hardware and software, and the development of sophisticated
               analytical methods. The increasing availability of large genomic
               data sets requires powerful statistical methods to analyse and
               interpret them, generating both computational and conceptual
               challenges for the field. This book provides a comprehensive
               coverage of modern statistical and computational methods used in
               molecular evolutionary analysis, such as maximum likelihood and
               Bayesian statistics. It describes the models, methods and
               algorithms that are most useful for analysing the
               ever-increasing supply of molecular sequence data, with a view
               to furthering our understanding of the evolution of genes and
               genomes. The book emphasizes essential concepts rather than
               mathematical proofs. It includes detailed derivations and
               implementation details, as well as numerous illustrations,
               worked examples, and exercises.",

  abstract  = "I present a new statistical method for analysing the
               relationship between two discrete characters that are measured
               across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations.
               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the
               group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two
               characters. The method takes into account information on the
               lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops
               estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and
               tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying
               upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A
               likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between
               two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for
               independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing
               for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional
               hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an
               application to the Hominoidea.",

              and analysis in the R language. Previously it was only possible
              to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R.
              phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing
              phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or
              maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation.
              Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the
              possibility of estimating mixture and partition models.
              Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing
              trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data
              and performing congruence analyses. AVAILABILITY: phangorn can be

               phylogenetics and evolution) software package has grown steadily
               over the years. Among its features, it has a strong
               distance-based component allowing the user to compute distances
               from aligned DNA sequences based on most methods from the
               literature and also build phylogenetic trees from them. However,
               even data generated with modern genomic approaches can fail to
               give rise to sufficiently reliable distance estimates. One way
               to overcome this problem is to exclude such estimates from data
               analysis giving rise to an incomplete distance data set (as
               opposed to a complete one). So far their analysis has been out
               of reach for ape. To remedy this, we have incorporated into ape
               several methods from the literature for phylogenetic inference
               from incomplete distance matrices. In addition, we have also
               extended ape's repertoire for phylogenetic inference from
               complete distances, added a new object class to efficiently
               encode sets of splits of taxa, and extended the functionality of
               some of its existing functions. AVAILABILITY: ape is distributed

               phylogenetics, and statistical phylogeography. The book presents
               and explains the models of nucleotide, amino acid, and codon
               substitution, and their use in calculating pairwise sequence
               distances and in reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. All major
               methods for phylogeny reconstruction are covered in detail,
               including neighbour joining, maximum parsimony, maximum
               likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Using motivating examples, the
               book includes a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian
               computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Advanced

  abstract = "The growth of phylogenetic trees in scope and in size is
              promising from the standpoint of understanding a wide variety of
              evolutionary patterns and processes. With trees comprised of
              larger, older, and globally distributed clades, it is likely that
              the lability of a binary character will differ significantly
              among lineages, which could lead to errors in estimating
              transition rates and the associated inference of ancestral
              states. Here we develop and implement a new method for
              identifying different rates of evolution in a binary character
              along different branches of a phylogeny. We illustrate this
              approach by exploring the evolution of growth habit in
              Campanulidae, a flowering plant clade containing some 35,000
              species. The distribution of woody versus herbaceous species
              calls into question the use of traditional models of binary
              character evolution. The recognition and accommodation of changes
              in the rate of growth form evolution in different lineages
              demonstrates, for the first time, a robust picture of growth form
              evolution across a very large, very old, and very widespread
